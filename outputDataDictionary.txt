This file defines inputs and outputs for the function **cover**.

Inputs:
* dataframe: csv file that includes rows for observations and columns for variables.  Two of these variables provide the latitude and longitude of the observations.
* lat_col:  column name for latitude variable in units of degrees.
* lon_col: column name for longitude variable in units of degrees.

Outputs:
*dataframe: with columns added to the input data frame.  The following lists the new columns
